GitHub Basics Content
1. The MacOS Terminal is a CLI (command-line interface) where you can directly communicate with the Mac’s operating system.  It’s based on UNIX and is the computer without the GUI (graphical user interface).

2. Although they work hand in hand, Git is a version control system that tracks and manages changes to files/code over time. GitHub is a SaaS (cloud-based) website where Git can be stored, shared, and worked on with others. I prefer to think Git is the software, and GitHub is the storage.

3. To fork a repository on GitHub using the Mac browser, you must...
	1)	Navigate to the desired repository on GitHub
	2)	Click Fork in the top-right corner of the page (looks like T with circles at each end)
	3)	Under “Owner”, select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repo
	4)	Choose to distinguish your fork in the “repository name” field, if not forks are named after their upstream repositories
	5)	Choose if you want to type a description of your fork in the “Description” field
	6)	Choose if you want to select “Copy the DEFAULT branch only”, if not, all branches get copied into the new fork
	7)	Click Create Fork

SIDENOTES!
Upstream repository = Original repository
Forks are used for proposing changes/ideas to someone else’s project without affecting the original code
